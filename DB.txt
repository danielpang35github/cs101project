CodePresent CS101//Nowadays, programmers actively sell their projects or some parts of them, but there are not many convenient ways to present their code. Usually, the options in such services are very limited. Our main goal is to create an easy-to-use application for code presentations. Developers will be able to upload code to our service and create text and video descriptions of their work. Each project will have its own page where all contributors will be listed. Other users will be able to see the uploaded projects, write comments and contact other developers. In this way, our platform will solve many problems of the final stage of the programming production and help coders to show their projects to the world in a very user-friendly way.//1,2,3,4,5//12/11/2021//path/to/video/file//codes/0//CodeProject
